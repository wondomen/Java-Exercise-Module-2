<h1>Exercise 9</h1>
<p>Write a function called even(), which receives an array containing numbers as a parameter. The function returns a
    second (usually smaller) array which has the even numbers of the original array. The function must not make changes
    to the original table.</p>
    <p>Example: In a three-item array, there are items 2, 7 and 4. The function returns a two-item array with items 2 and
        4.</p>
    <p>Print both the original array and the new array to the console in the main program after you have called the
        function.</p>
<p>You can hardcode the array, no need for prompt().</p>
